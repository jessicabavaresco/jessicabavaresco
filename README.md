### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jessica Bavaresco and I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the University of Geneva in the [Quantum Theory Group](https://www.unige.ch/gap/qic/theory/) led by Prof. Nicolas Brunner. 

I work on the field of quantum information. My main research interests are in quantum foundations, in particular, in causality in quantum theory and higher-order operations, steering and measurement incompatibility, and in entanglement theory. I'm also interested in the MUB existence problem and nonlocality activation problems. I'm excited to start working with quantum networks in the near future.  

You can find all of my papers in the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/bavaresco_j_1). 

I keep this repository to host and share the code that I develop for my research. Most of it is based on semidefinite programming. Feel free to take a look at it if you think it might be useful for you! If you find any bugs, or have comments and questions, I'd be happy to hear about it.

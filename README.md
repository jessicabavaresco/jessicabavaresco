### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jessica Bavaresco and I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the University of Geneva in the [Quantum Theory Group](https://www.unige.ch/gap/qic/theory/) led by Prof. Nicolas Brunner. 

I work on the field of quantum information. My main research interests are in higher-order operations and quantum correlations. Some of the topics I have worked on recently involve channel discrimination, genuine multipartite entanglement, metrology, boxworld correlations, and causality in quantum mechanics.

You can find all of my papers on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/bavaresco_j_1), or check out my [website](https://jessicabavaresco.github.io).

I keep this repository to host and share the code that I develop for my research. Most of it is based on semidefinite programming. Feel free to take a look at it if you think it might be useful for you! If you find any bugs, or have comments and questions, I'd be happy to hear about it.

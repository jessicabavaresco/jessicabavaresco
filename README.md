### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Jessica Bavaresco. I'm a permanent research scientist (<em>CNRS chargÃ©e de recherche</em>) in the <a href='https://qi.lip6.fr'>QI team</a> at <a href='https://www.lip6.fr/jessica.bavaresco'>LIP6,</a> a CNRS & Sorbonne University computer science laboratory in Paris, France. I work with quantum information science.

My main research interests are in higher-order operations and quantum correlations. Some of the topics I have worked on recently involve quantum networks, Bell nonlocality, channel discrimination, genuine multipartite entanglement, metrology, boxworld correlations, and indefinite causal order.

You can find all of my papers on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/a/bavaresco_j_1), or check out my [website](https://jessicabavaresco.github.io).

I keep this repository to host and share the code that I develop for my research. Most of it is based on semidefinite programming. Feel free to take a look at it if you think it might be useful for you! If you find any bugs, or have comments and questions, I'd be happy to hear about it.
